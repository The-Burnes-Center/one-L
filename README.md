# 📌 One-L Legal AI Document Review System

> _AI-powered legal document analysis platform that automatically identifies conflicts between vendor contract submissions and Massachusetts state requirements._

---

## 🎬 Demo

The system provides a React-based interface with session management, real-time progress tracking, and automated redlined document generation.

> **Key Demo Flow**: Upload vendor contracts → Step Functions workflow orchestrates AI analysis against MA legal requirements → Download redlined documents with conflict annotations

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🔍 **Automated Conflict Detection**: AI-powered analysis using Claude 4 Sonnet to identify conflicts between vendor contract language and Massachusetts legal requirements

- 📝 **Intelligent Document Redlining**: Automatically generates marked-up documents highlighting specific conflicts, modifications, and legal issues  
  Creates downloadable redlined versions with detailed conflict annotations and rationale.

- 🏛️ **Massachusetts Legal Compliance**: Specialized knowledge base containing MA state requirements, ITS Terms & Conditions, EOTSS policies, and procurement regulations  
  Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for accurate legal context and analysis.

- 📊 **Session-Based Workflow**: Organize document reviews into tracked sessions with complete audit trails and historical results  
  Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket integration for Step Functions workflow execution (2-5 minute AI analysis tasks).

> **Note**: The architecture diagram shows the complete system flow. The document analysis process is orchestrated by **AWS Step Functions**, which coordinates all Lambda functions in a multi-stage workflow.

The system follows a modern serverless microservices architecture on AWS, orchestrated by **AWS Step Functions**:

```
[React SPA] → [CloudFront CDN] → [API Gateway + WebSocket API] → 
[Step Functions State Machine] → [Lambda Functions] → 
[Bedrock AI + Knowledge Base] → [OpenSearch + S3 + DynamoDB]
```

**Key Components:**
- **Frontend**: React SPA with real-time WebSocket integration for Step Functions progress tracking
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with OAuth 2.0 flows
- **Workflow Orchestration**: **AWS Step Functions** - Orchestrates the entire document analysis workflow (11 stages)
- **AI Engine**: AWS Bedrock with Claude 4 Sonnet and Knowledge Base RAG (invoked by Step Functions)
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda functions (12 functions) orchestrated by Step Functions state machine
- **Storage**: Multi-tier S3 architecture with OpenSearch Serverless vector database
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK with modular construct-based deployment

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install CDK dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure constants (REQUIRED before deployment)
# Edit constants.py to set your stack name and Cognito domain
# Prod branch: STACK_NAME = "OneL-Prod"

# Deploy the infrastructure (creates Step Functions state machine + all Lambda functions)
cdk bootstrap  # One-time setup per AWS account/region
cdk deploy

# Build and deploy frontend (handled automatically by CDK)
cd one_l/user_interface
npm install
npm run build
```

## 🌍 AI Analysis Flow (Step Functions Workflow)

The system employs a sophisticated multi-stage AI analysis workflow orchestrated by AWS Step Functions:

1. 📄 **Document Ingestion** → Upload vendor submissions and reference documents with session-based organization  
2. 🔍 **Knowledge Base Sync** → Vector embedding and indexing using Titan Embed Text v2 for reference documents  
3. 🚀 **Workflow Initiation** → StartWorkflow Lambda triggers Step Functions state machine  
4. 📑 **Document Splitting** → Chunks large documents for parallel processing  
5. 🧠 **Structure Analysis** → Analyzes document structure and generates adaptive KB queries  
6. 🔎 **Knowledge Retrieval** → Retrieves relevant context from knowledge base for all queries  
7. ⚖️ **Conflict Detection** → Claude 4 Sonnet identifies contradictions, modifications, omissions, and reversals  
8. 🔀 **Result Merging** → Combines parallel chunk results into unified analysis  
9. 📝 **Document Redlining** → Generates marked-up documents with detailed conflict annotations  
10. 💾 **Results Storage** → Structured conflict data saved to DynamoDB with session tracking  
11. 🧹 **Cleanup** → Removes temporary processing files

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every service interaction requires authentication and authorization
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (S3/DynamoDB encryption)
- **Fine-Grained IAM**: Least privilege access with service-specific roles and policies
- **User Authentication**: AWS Cognito with strong password policies and JWT token management
- **Audit Trail**: Complete session tracking and analysis history for compliance
- **No Data Retention**: Documents processed securely with configurable retention policies
